# Assignment
## Method used
The method that I have used in making this project made with Create React App was simply using the fetch (not used axios or installed any other libraries) method with async/await (ES6 Syntax) for getting the data from api. Created different component for navbar and content. Also shown the error and loading state while fetching the api.
